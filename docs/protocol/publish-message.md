# publish

Sends a value to a channel, delivering it to all subscribers (broadcast) or the next subscriber (queue).

## Example

```json
{"type":"publish","channelId":"notifications","value":"System update available"}
```

With an object value:

```json
{"type":"publish","channelId":"events","value":{"type":"click","target":"submit","timestamp":1234567890}}
```

## Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `type` | string | yes | `"publish"` |
| `channelId` | string | yes | Target channel ID |
| `value` | any | yes | Value to publish (any JSON type) |

## Behavior

- The value is delivered to subscribers based on the channel's mode:
  - **broadcast**: every subscriber receives the value
  - **queue**: one subscriber receives it (round-robin)
- The value is written to each subscriber's `targetPath` in the data model.
- The last published value is stored at `/channels/{channelId}/value`.
- If the channel does not exist, the message is ignored.
