# include

Includes another JSONL file, inlining its messages at the current position in the stream.

## Example

```json
{"type":"include","path":"components/sidebar.jsonl"}
```

## Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `type` | string | yes | `"include"` |
| `path` | string | yes | Path to the JSONL file to include |

## Behavior

- The file is read and its messages are processed in order, as if they appeared inline.
- Paths are resolved relative to the including file's directory.
- Includes can be nested (an included file can include other files).
- Maximum nesting depth is **10** to prevent infinite recursion.
- If the file does not exist, an error is logged and processing continues.

## Use Cases

- Split a large app into modular files (one per screen or feature).
- Share component definitions across multiple apps.
- Load a standard set of `defineComponent` and `defineFunction` messages.

## Example: Modular App

**main.jsonl:**
```json
{"type":"include","path":"lib/components.jsonl"}
{"type":"include","path":"lib/functions.jsonl"}
{"type":"createSurface","surfaceId":"main","title":"My App","width":800,"height":600}
{"type":"include","path":"screens/home.jsonl"}
```

**lib/components.jsonl:**
```json
{"type":"defineComponent","name":"NavButton","params":["label","target"],"components":[...]}
```

**screens/home.jsonl:**
```json
{"type":"updateComponents","surfaceId":"main","components":[...]}
```
