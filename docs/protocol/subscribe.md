# subscribe

Registers a subscription on a channel. When values are published, they are written to the specified data model path.

## Example

```json
{"type":"subscribe","channelId":"notifications","targetPath":"/lastNotification"}
```

## Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `type` | string | yes | -- | `"subscribe"` |
| `channelId` | string | yes | -- | Channel to subscribe to |
| `processId` | string | no | `""` | Subscribe on behalf of a process (empty = session-level) |
| `targetPath` | string | no | `""` | JSON Pointer path where received values are written |

## Behavior

- When a value is published to the channel, it is written to `targetPath` on every surface's data model.
- Components bound to that path re-render automatically.
- In broadcast mode, all subscribers receive each value.
- In queue mode, values are delivered round-robin to one subscriber at a time.
